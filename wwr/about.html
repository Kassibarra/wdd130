<p class="parrafo">In this tour you will be able to enjoy several activities full of adrenaline and fun; all these you will be able to do in 3 unforgettable days, accompanied by our professional guides.
Adventurous travellers who live for active vacations will find a lot to love in a multi-sport trip. These types of itineraries typically combine several different types of activities into a single trip, breaking up the routine and finding new ways to challenge us. A multi-sport excursion could combine rafting, biking and sea kayaking for instance, or even throw mountain biking, hiking, and river rafting into the mix as well.    
If this sounds like a fun way to spend your holiday on 3 days of Adventure..</p>
